There are three subfolders below the trapit root folder:
- `examples`: Two working powershell examples are included in their own subfolders, with both test scripts and a main script that shows how the unit under test would normally be called
- `install`: This holds the project library source code and a script to copy the module to the first folder in the powershell path
- `node_modules`: npm root
- `png`: This holds the image files for the README
- `unit_test`: Root folder for unit testing of the Get-UT_TemplateObject function, with subfolder having the results files
