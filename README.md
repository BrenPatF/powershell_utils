<img src="mountains.png">
This project has the code and other artefacts for small Powershell modules.

:file_cabinet:

- [README: Utils](Utils/README.md)

## TrapitUtils
The TrapitUtils module comprises a set of Powershell utility functions for unit testing following [The Math Function Unit Testing Design Pattern](https://brenpatf.github.io/2023/06/05/the-math-function-unit-testing-design-pattern.html).

- [README: TrapitUtils](TrapitUtils/README.md)

## TimerSet
The TimerSet module contains a class that facilitates code timing for instrumentation and other purposes, with very small footprint in both code and resource usage.

- [README: TimerSet](TimerSet/README.md)

## MDUtils
The MDUtils module contains a utility that that automates the creation of a hierarchy of heading links in markdown documents.

- [README: MDUtils](MDUtils/README.md)

## OracleUtils
The OracleUtils module contains a Powershell utility that facilitates installation of an Oracle database module comprising components such as tables, views, packages etc. by means of a set of SQL\*Plus scripts. These scripts have to be created separately for the particular Oracle module, while the Powershell utility coordinates their execution. The utility also allows for copying of files to a folder, such as a folder used for data loading via external tables.
